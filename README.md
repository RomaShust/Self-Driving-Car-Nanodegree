# Self Driving Car program

## Nanodegree includes following projects

> *Identification of lane lines on the road, first in an image, and later in a video stream*

> *Application of convolutional neural network to classify traffic signs*

> *Training a deep neural network to drive a car*

> *A software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video from a front-facing camera on a car*

> *A software pipeline to identify vehicles in a video from a front-facing camera on a car*

> *Implementation of an Extended Kalman Filter for sensor fusion problem*

> *Implementation of a PID controller in C++ to maneuver the vehicle around the track*
