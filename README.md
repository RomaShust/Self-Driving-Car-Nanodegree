# Self-Driving-Car-Nanodegree

## Nanodegree includes following projects

##### 1. Finding Lane Lines on the Road

> *Identification of lane lines on the road, first in an image, and later in a video stream*

##### 2. Traffic Sign Classifier

> *Application of convolutional neural network to classify traffic signs*

##### 3. Behavioral Cloning

> *I have trained a deep neural network to drive a car*

##### 4. Advanced Lane Finding

> *here goal was to write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video from a front-facing camera on a car*

##### 5. Vehicle Tracking

> *I wrote a software pipeline to identify vehicles in a video from a front-facing camera on a car*

##### 6. Extended Kalman Filters

> *I implemented an Extended Kalman Filter for sensor fusion problem*

##### 7. Unscented Kalman Filters

##### 8. Kidnapped Vehicle

> *Here, I built a particle filter and combined it with a real map to localize a vehicle*

##### 9. PID Controller

> *Implementing a PID controller in C++ to maneuver the vehicle around the track*
